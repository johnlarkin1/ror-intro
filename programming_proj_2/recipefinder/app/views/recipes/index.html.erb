<!-- note:
    you have to specify your URL search term in the following format:
    http://localhost:3000/recipes/index?search=swiss

    which is just arbitrary and dumb. 
    the default page does link to chocolate though which is a necessary condition that the site specifies.

    The sanitize feature is interestaing and yeah i had to read over the html to see what was going on. the functionality is specified here.

    Sanitize recipe titles displayed. Rails automatically escapes HTML in your strings (to avoid XSS attacks http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting). Because of this, some of your titles will look wrong. For example, try searching for mocha and look at your titles. To get around this issue, Rails has a sanitize (or raw) helper (http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionView/Helpers/SanitizeHelper.html#method-i-sanitize) that will help you display HTML characters properly
